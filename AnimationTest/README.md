## Diving into Animation: Exploring Texture Mapping and Lighting in OpenGL

In this project, I delved deep into the world of animation within OpenGL, experimenting with various orientations, rotations, and movement of objects. But that's not all â€“ I also dabbled in the intricate interplay of different lighting effects and shade models.

From smoothly surfaced objects bathed in soft illumination to flat-lit surfaces, I explored the dynamic range of lighting possibilities.

Adding to the spectacle, I introduced a textured object into the mix, orchestrating its mesmerizing motion in a half-circle trajectory using sine and cosine functions.
