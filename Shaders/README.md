## Exploring Shaders with Sphere Deformation

In this project, I delved into the world of shaders for the very first time. Armed with vertex and fragment shader files, I set out to manipulate the surface of a simple sphere object and bring it to life with mesmerizing ripple animations.

Using the vertex shader, I deformed the surface of the sphere, creating captivating ripples that danced across its entirety. Meanwhile, the fragment shader took charge of coloring the sphere's surface, employing ST coordinates to achieve a vibrant and dynamic visual effect.

The result? A spectacle of motion and color that breathed new life into the humble sphere. Check out the snapshots capturing the magic in action:
