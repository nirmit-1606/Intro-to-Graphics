## Cessna: Animated Propellers and Inside-Out Perspectives

I took an existing Cessna model and jazzed it up by adding two propellers to each wing, each set rotating dynamically. Additionally, there's a unique propeller at the front with its own speed and orientation. But that's not all! I also incorporated two distinct views â€“ outside and inside the plane. 

In the inside view, the scene rotation is disabled, providing a stable perspective, and the propellers remain static. However, what makes the inside view truly captivating is a meticulously crafted design pattern placed in front of the scene (outside the plane). This pattern, created using sin and cos functions, offers a delightful focal point for passengers peering out from within the Cessna.

Take a peek at the snapshots showcasing the different perspectives:
