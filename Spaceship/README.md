#Spaceship Simulation and Day-Night Exploration

In this simulation, I've imported various obj files to craft a dynamic experience.

At the heart of it all is a sleek spaceship model, complete with textured surfaces that lend it an air of authenticity. Using intuitive keyboard controls ([WASDQE]), one can navigate the spaceship through six directions, feeling the thrill of interstellar travel.

But the excitement doesn't end there. As one maneuver through space, a ball-like object illuminates in the opposite direction, simulating the thrust of the ship. And keep an eye on the ring rotating around the spaceship – it moves with it, adding to the sense of motion and immersion.

Step inside the spaceship (inside view), and you'll find yourself in a verdant forest-like area on the upper half, populated with randomly placed trees. Below, a bustling cityscape unfolds, with buildings reaching toward the heavens.

Day and night cycle seamlessly, casting shifting light and shadows across the landscape. The transition is orchestrated by a sphere object, ensuring that both the forest and cityscapes are bathed in alternating light.

To optimize performance, the scene dynamically adjusts, displaying only the necessary objects based on your viewpoint – ensuring smooth rendering even in the most detailed environments.
