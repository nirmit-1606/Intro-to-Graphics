## Texture Mapping

In this project, I delved into the fascinating realm of texture mapping, where I learned to apply textures onto object surfaces. This particular project involved taking a texture of the world and binding it onto a spherical object. The result? A stunning depiction of Earth suspended in a dark, cosmic void.

But the magic doesn't stop there â€“ I also implemented a toggle feature, allowing me to switch the texture binding on and off at will, revealing the raw geometry beneath.
