## Curves: Bezier and Catmull

In this enchanting project, I brought a butterfly to life using the elegance of Bezier and Catmull curves. These curves, defined by a set of control points, weave a seamless, continuous path through space, perfect for animating the delicate motion of butterfly wings.

With the Bezier curve, I explored both the controlled and freeform versions, witnessing how the placement of control points influences the smoothness and trajectory of the animation. Check out the snapshots to see the Bezier curve in action:

Next, I ventured into the realm of Catmull curves. Like the Bezier curve, I showcased both the curve with and without control points to demonstrate its versatility and precision. Take a glimpse at the snapshots capturing the Catmull curve's beauty:
